'''
Heap is a special tree-based data structure. A binary tree is said to follow a heap data structure if:
1 - it is a complete binary tree



===============
If the index of any element in the array is i, 
the element in the index 2i+1 will become the left child and 
element in 2i+2 index will become the right child. Also,
the parent of any element at index i is given by the lower bound of (i-1)/2.
